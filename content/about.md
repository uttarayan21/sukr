title: About
---

I'm Tim DeHerrera (nrdxp), an engineer at [IOG](https://iog.io) where I help develop interoperable blockchain infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.

As co-founder of the [Ekala Project](https://github.com/ekala-project), I'm building next-generation tooling for reproducible builds and declarative systems.

With a decade of experience in distributed systems, build infrastructure, and network optimization, I craft tools that emphasize reproducibility and determinism. My engineering approach leverages expressive type systems and functional programming paradigms, with current focus on the Rust and Nix ecosystems.

If you're interested in working together, supporting open source, or just want to discuss something interesting, consider [collaborating](/collab) with me or reaching out through any of the social links above.
