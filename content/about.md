title: About
---

I'm Tim DeHerrera (nrdxp), an engineer at [IOG](https://iog.io) where I work on blockchain infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.

I co-founded the [Ekala Project](https://github.com/ekala-project) to build better tooling for reproducible builds and declarative systems.

I've spent about a decade working on distributed systems, build infrastructure, and network optimization. I mostly work in Rust and Nix these days, though I'll pick up whatever gets the job done. Reproducibility and determinism matter to me—probably more than they should.

If any of this sounds interesting, check out the [collab](/collab.html) page or hit me up through the social links above.
